# DungeonGame
A java game I'm making for practice. Based around a text adventure concept.

Made some changes to refactor the game to run in a loop and have some objects setup for the various types of elements that might be present in a game like this.

To run it compile then execute the java program

`javac Game.java`

`java Game`

## Prerequisites

Assumes have JDK 9+

`sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk -Y`
